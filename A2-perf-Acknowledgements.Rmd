\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}

\bigskip By far the greatest thanks must go to my supervisor for
the guidance, care and support they provided. 

\bigskip\noindent Thanks 
must also go to Emily, Michelle, John and Alex who helped by
proof-reading the document in the final stages of preparation.

\bigskip\noindent Although
I have not lived with them for a number of years, my family also deserve
many thanks for their encouragement.

\bigskip\noindent Thanks go to Robert Taggart for allowing his thesis
style to be shamelessly copied.

\bigskip\bigskip\bigskip\noindent Fred Flintstone, 2 November 2015.

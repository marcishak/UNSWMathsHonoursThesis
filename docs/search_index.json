Thanks must also go to Emily, Michelle, John and Alex who helped by proof-reading the document in the final stages of preparation. Although I have not lived with them for a number of years, my family also deserve many thanks for their encouragement. Thanks go to Robert Taggart for allowing his thesis style to be shamelessly copied. Fred Flintstone, 2 November 2015.

Later chapters should be divided into coherent pieces describing your analysis. The final chapter should provide some concluding remarks, discussion, ideas for future research, and so on. Appendixes can contain additional material that dont fit into any chapters, but that you want to put on record. For example, additional tables, output, etc. 1.1 Rmarkdown In this template, the rest of the chapter shows how to use Rmarkdown. The big advantage of using Rmarkdown is that it allows you to include your R code directly into your thesis, to ensure there are no errors in copying and pasting, and that everything is reproducible. It also helps you stay better organized. For details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com. 1.2 Data Included in this template is a file called sales.csv. This contains quarterly data on Sales and Advertising budget for a small company over the period 19812005. It also contains the GDP (gross domestic product) over the same period. All series have been adjusted for inflation. We can load in this data set using the following command: sales &lt;- ts(read.csv(&quot;data/sales.csv&quot;)[,-1], start=1981, frequency=4) Any data you use in your thesis can go into the data directory. The data should be in exactly the format you obtained it. Do no editing or manipulation of the data outside of R. Any data munging should be scripted in R and form part of your thesis files (possibly hidden in the output). 1.3 Figures Figure shows time plots of the data we just loaded. Notice how figure captions and references work. Chunk names can be used as figure labels with fig: prefixed. Never manually type figure numbers, as they can change when you add or delete figures. This way, the figure numbering is always correct. Figure 1.1: Quarterly sales, advertising and GDP data. 1.4 Results from analyses We can fit a dynamic regression model to the sales data. If \\(y_t\\) denotes the sales in quarter \\(t\\), \\(x_t\\) denotes the corresponding advertising budget and \\(z_t\\) denotes the GDP, then the resulting model is: \\[\\begin{equation} y_t - y_{t-4} = \\beta (x_t-x_{t-4}) + \\gamma (z_t-z_{t-4}) + \\theta_1 \\varepsilon_{t-1} + \\Theta_1 \\varepsilon_{t-4} + \\varepsilon_t \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\beta = 2.28\\), \\(\\gamma = 0.97\\), \\(\\theta_1 = NA\\), and \\(\\Theta_1 = -0.90\\). 1.5 Tables Lets assume future advertising spend and GDP are at the current levels. Then forecasts for the next year are given in Table . Again, notice the use of labels and references to automatically generate table numbers. In this case, we need to generate the label ourselves. The knitLatex package is useful for generating tables from R output. Other packages can do similar things including the kable function in knitr which is somewhat simpler but you have less control over the result. If you use knitLatex to generate tables, dont forget to include results=\"asis\" in the chunk settings.

Topics that are well-known to them do not have to be included here. But things that they may not know about should be included. Resist the temptation to discuss everything youve read in the last year. Do not organize your chapter around the papers you have read with one section per paper. Instead, you should organize your chapters around themes, and within each theme provide a story explaining the development of ideas. It is usually helpful to plan out a table of contents first with major section headings. When you are discussing results from several papers or books, you will need to adopt a common notation to ensure your chapter makes sense. Do not use different notation for the same thing. 2.2 Citations All citations should be done using markdown notation as shown below. This way, your bibliography will be compiled automatically and correctly. Exponential smoothing was originally developed in the late 1950s [@Brown59;@Brown63;@Holt57;@Winters60]. Because of their computational simplicity and interpretability, they became widely used in practice. Empirical studies by @MH79 and @Metal82 found little difference in forecast accuracy between exponential smoothing and ARIMA models. This made the family of exponential smoothing procedures an attractive proposition [see @CKOS01]. The methods were less popular in academic circles until @OKS97 introduced a state space formulation of some of the methods, which was extended in @HKSG02 to cover the full range of exponential smoothing methods. 2.3 External Scripts You can include scripts that are not directly embedded into the Rmd format by using code=xfun::read_utf8(\"path/scripts/script.R\") in the chunk options eg: {r echo=TRUE, code=xfun::read_utf8('scripts/histnorm.R')}: # histnorm.R # Takes 1000s draws of a normal distribution and plots it&#39;s histogram # draw samples vec &lt;- rnorm(1000) # plot histogram hist(vec) or by using labelled blocks in your script and using them as individual chunks "],["additional-stuff.html", "Chapter 3 Additional stuff", " Chapter 3 Additional stuff You might put some computer output here, or maybe additional tables. Note that line 5 must appear before your first appendix. But other appendices can just start like any other chapter. "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
